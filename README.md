# HTML-Purple-Belt
All of the completed HTML purple belt projects for Hackingtons.com. Teacher resource

## Goal
The purple belt is the beginning of professional CSS and website design. From this point on we want the websites built by the students to look professional, no more red text on pink backgrounds. The color aqua should be banned lol.

## Time
These projects are not huge but there is a lot of typing. Let them take their time here.

# Common-problems:
    1) The most common error you will see on every project is nested divs incorrectly
    2) Class names in css are missing the .
    3) The hamburger test should resemble a hamburger, two buns, patty, and at least 1 topping. NO SQUARE parts
